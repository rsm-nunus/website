## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

## Background 

Charitable organizations often rely on fundraising letters to solicit donations, but little rigorous evidence has been available to guide how those letters should be designed. In a groundbreaking field experiment, economists Dean Karlan and John List set out to test how different **framing strategies and financial incentives** affect individual donation behavior.

The experiment, conducted in collaboration with a politically-oriented nonprofit organization, involved mailing **50,083 fundraising letters** to previous donors. Crucially, the recipients were **randomly assigned** to different treatment groups, allowing the researchers to measure **causal effects** rather than mere correlations.

## Purpose of the Study

Karlan and List aimed to answer a simple but important question:  
> *Do people give more when their donation is matched? And if so, does the size of the match matter?*

They also explored additional behavioral levers commonly used in fundraising, such as **challenge framing**, **suggested donation amounts**, and **goal-based appeals**.

## Experimental Design 

The letters fell into three broad treatment types:

1. **Standard Fundraising Letter (Control)**  
   - A typical letter requesting support for the organization, with no additional incentives or matching language.

2. **Matching Grant Letter**  
   - Included a paragraph stating that a **leadership donor** would match any contribution at one of three possible ratios:  
     - 1:1 (every dollar given is doubled)  
     - 2:1 (every dollar is tripled)  
     - 3:1 (every dollar quadrupled)  
   - Matching offers also varied by **threshold**, i.e., the maximum amount the leadership donor would match:  
     - $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or **unstated**.
   - Suggested donation levels were tailored based on each recipient’s previous giving history:  
     - Their highest previous gift  
     - 1.25× their highest gift  
     - 1.5× their highest gift

3. **Challenge Grant Letter**  
   - Framed the offer as part of a collective effort or campaign challenge, appealing to urgency and social impact rather than pure match mechanics.

Because each component (match ratio, threshold, suggested donation amount) was **randomized independently** within the matching grant group, the experiment had a **factorial design** — allowing the researchers to isolate and measure the effects of each variable.

## Why This Matters 

At the time of the study, fundraisers often relied on **rules of thumb and anecdotes**, lacking hard data on what actually drives giving. Karlan and List’s approach brought **scientific rigor** to the domain of nonprofit fundraising by:

- Leveraging **random assignment** to establish causality
- Testing commonly used marketing strategies under **real-world conditions**
- Generating insights with **practical implications** for organizations seeking to raise more money

## Contribution to the Literature 

This study represents one of the first **large-scale natural field experiments** in charitable giving. It moved beyond lab settings and survey experiments to observe real decisions involving real money. The results helped bridge the gap between **behavioral economics** and **fundraising practice**, offering evidence-backed recommendations on:

- The efficacy of matching offers  
- How much match ratios influence behavior  
- Whether people respond to thresholds or suggested amounts  
- The heterogeneous effects by donor characteristics and geography

## Project Overview

In this replication study, I used the same dataset provided by Karlan and List to:

- Reproduce their key findings
- Validate the statistical robustness of their claims
- Explore new visualizations and simulations that illuminate the behavioral mechanisms at play
- Reflect on what this experiment teaches us about **human motivation**, **social framing**, and **economic incentives** in the context of public goods

This report follows a structured analysis of donation likelihood, donation size, and how different dimensions of the match offer (ratio, threshold, framing) influence both.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains over 50,000 observations from a field experiment in charitable giving. Variables include treatment assignments, donation behavior, match ratio conditions, prior giving history, and demographic information.

Below is a summary of key variable distributions and data structure.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')
df.info()
df.describe()
```

### Balance Test 

As an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.

I tested whether the treatment and control groups differed in prior donor behavior by comparing the number of months since last donation (mrm2). Both a two-sample t-test (t = 0.120, p = 0.905) and a linear regression of mrm2 ~ treatment (β = 0.0137, p = 0.905) confirm no statistically significant difference. This supports the randomization mechanism and matches Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007).

```{python}
from scipy import stats

# Clean data: drop NAs
df_clean = df[["mrm2", "treatment", "control"]].dropna()

# Split groups
treat = df_clean[df_clean['treatment'] == 1]['mrm2']
control = df_clean[df_clean['control'] == 1]['mrm2']

# Perform Welch's t-test (no assumption of equal variances)
ttest = stats.ttest_ind(treat, control, equal_var=False)

# Print results
print(f"T-test result: t = {ttest.statistic:.3f}, p = {ttest.pvalue:.3f}")

import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Regression of mrm2 on treatment
model = smf.ols("mrm2 ~ treatment", data=df_clean).fit()
model.summary()

# Extract relevant results
results_table = pd.DataFrame({
    'Variable': model.params.index,
    'Coefficient': model.params.values,
    'Std. Error': model.bse.values,
    'p-value': model.pvalues.values,
    '95% CI Lower': model.conf_int()[0].values,
    '95% CI Upper': model.conf_int()[1].values
})

# Round for presentation
results_table = results_table.round(4)
results_table


```

<b> Interpretation </b>

I assessed the balance between treatment and control groups using both statistical methods:

- **T-Test**:  
  - *t* = 0.120, *p* = 0.905  
  - Result: *Not statistically significant*

- **Regression**:  
  - Coefficient on `treatment` ≈ **0.014**  
  - *p*-value ≈ **0.905**  
  - 95% Confidence Interval: *Includes zero*

These results confirm **no significant difference** in `mrm2` across groups, supporting the **randomization mechanism**. This aligns with *Table 1* in *Karlan & List (2007)*, where the group means were:

| **Group**   | **Mean Months Since Last Donation** |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Treatment   | 13.012                               |
| Control     | 12.998                               |


## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made 

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
gave_by_group = df.groupby("treatment")["gave"].mean().reset_index()
gave_by_group["group"] = gave_by_group["treatment"].map({0: "Control", 1: "Treatment"})

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.bar(gave_by_group["group"], gave_by_group["gave"], width=0.5)
plt.title("Proportion Who Donated by Group")
plt.ylabel("Proportion Gave")
plt.ylim(0, gave_by_group["gave"].max() + 0.01)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

I compared the **response rate** (i.e., whether a donation was made) between treatment and control groups.

The bar plot below shows that the **treatment group**, who received a matching grant offer, donated at a higher rate than the **control group**, who received a standard letter.

This visual confirms the core finding in Karlan & List (2007): **matching donations increased participation in charitable giving.**

```{python}
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Ensure binary outcome is correctly typed
df['gave'] = df['gave'].astype(int)

# T-test: response rate (gave) between treatment and control groups
gave_treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']
gave_control = df[df['control'] == 1]['gave']
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(gave_treat, gave_control, equal_var=False)

# Display t-test result
print(f"T-test result:\nt = {t_stat:.3f}, p = {p_val:.4f}\n")

# Regression: response as a function of treatment
reg_gave = smf.ols('gave ~ treatment', data=df).fit()

print('Regression Results:')
# Extract and format regression results
results_table = pd.DataFrame({
    'Variable': reg_gave.params.index,
    'Coefficient': reg_gave.params.values,
    'Std. Error': reg_gave.bse.values,
    'p-value': reg_gave.pvalues.values,
    '95% CI Lower': reg_gave.conf_int()[0].values,
    '95% CI Upper': reg_gave.conf_int()[1].values
}).round(4)

results_table

```

<b> Charitable Contribution Made </b>

I examined whether receiving a matching donation offer increases the likelihood of making a charitable donation. This is measured using the binary variable `gave`, which equals 1 if a donation was made and 0 otherwise.

I used both a **t-test** and a **bivariate linear regression** to assess the difference in response rate between treatment and control groups.

<b> Results Summary </b>

| Method         | Effect Size            | p-value | Interpretation             |
|----------------|------------------------|---------|----------------------------|
| T-Test         | t = 3.21               | 0.0013  | Statistically significant  |
| Regression     | +0.0042 (0.42%)        | 0.002   | Statistically significant  |

- **Control group donation rate** ≈ 1.79%  
- **Treatment group donation rate** ≈ 2.21%

These values **match** the response rates reported in **Table 2A, Panel A** of *Karlan & List (2007)*.


<b> Table 2A (Panel A): Response Rate Comparison </b>

| Group      | Response Rate | Std. Error |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Control    | 0.018          | (0.001)    |
| Treatment  | 0.022          | (0.001)    |
| Match 1:1  | 0.021          | (0.001)    |

| Match 3:1  | 0.023          | (0.001)    |

<b> Interpretation </b>

Even a small increase in the likelihood of giving — about **0.4 percentage points** — is **statistically significant** in a large-scale field experiment with over 50,000 individuals.

This result shows that:
- Matching donations have a **causal impact** on behavior.
- People are **more likely to respond** to donation appeals when told their gift will be matched.
- The **psychological effect** (e.g., feeling of leverage, social validation, urgency) may be as important as the financial incentive.

Thus, matched donations are an effective strategy not just in economics but in **behavioral design** for charitable fundraising.


```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Prepare the variables
X = sm.add_constant(df["treatment"])
y = df["gave"]

# Run the Probit regression
probit_model = sm.Probit(y, X)
probit_results = probit_model.fit()

# probit_results.summary()


# Extract and format Probit results
probit_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Variable": probit_results.params.index,
    "Coefficient": probit_results.params.values,
    "Std. Error": probit_results.bse.values,

}).round(4)
print("\nProbit Results:")

```

<b> Probit Regression: Impact of Matching Grant on Donation Likelihood </b>

To replicate **Table 3, Column (1)** from *Karlan & List (2007)*, I estimated a **Probit model** where the outcome is whether a donation was made (`gave = 1`) and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment (`treatment = 1`).


<b> Our Probit Model Results </b>

| Variable   | Coefficient | Std. Error | z-value | p-value | 95% CI             |
|------------|-------------|------------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| Intercept  | -2.100      | 0.023      | -90.07  | < 0.001 | [-2.146, -2.054]   |
| Treatment  | **0.087**   | 0.028      | 3.11    | **0.002** | [0.032, 0.141]     |

- **Pseudo R²**: 0.001  
- **Observations**: 50,083

These results match the direction and significance of **Table 3, Column (1)** in the original study.

**Notes:**
- The paper reports *marginal effects*, whereas our Probit output gives **latent index coefficients**.
- The magnitude of 0.004 in the paper corresponds to a **marginal increase in probability** of donating due to the treatment.
- Our coefficient of **0.087** reflects the effect on the underlying *propensity to give*, which is standard in Probit estimation.

<b> Interpretation </b>

Despite a small effect size, the impact of being offered a **matching donation** is **statistically significant**. This suggests:

- **Even subtle nudges**, like framing a gift as matched by a leadership donor, can increase participation.
- The result is economically meaningful due to the **large sample size** and **real-world behavioral context**.

In short: **human generosity is sensitive to framing** — and donors are more likely to act when they feel their gift has leverage.



### Differences between Match Rates

Next, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

```{python}
# Subset the data for different match ratios
# According to the dataset: ratio = '1', '2', '3' for 1:1, 2:1, 3:1
df_ratio = df[df["treatment"] == 1].copy()
df_ratio["ratio"] = df_ratio["ratio"].astype(str)

# Extract binary 'gave' for each match ratio group
gave_1_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "1"]["gave"]
gave_2_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "2"]["gave"]
gave_3_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "3"]["gave"]

# Perform t-tests between match ratio groups
ttest_1_vs_2 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_2_1, equal_var=False)
ttest_1_vs_3 = ttest_ind(gave_1_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)
ttest_2_vs_3 = ttest_ind(gave_2_1, gave_3_1, equal_var=False)

# ttest_1_vs_2, ttest_1_vs_3, ttest_2_vs_3

# Create clean results table
t_test_results = pd.DataFrame({
    "Comparison": ["1:1 vs 2:1", "1:1 vs 3:1", "2:1 vs 3:1"],
    "t-statistic": [ttest_1_vs_2.statistic, ttest_1_vs_3.statistic, ttest_2_vs_3.statistic],
    "p-value": [ttest_1_vs_2.pvalue, ttest_1_vs_3.pvalue, ttest_2_vs_3.pvalue]
}).round(4)
print('t test Results:')
t_test_results

```

<b> Does Match Ratio Size Affect Donation Rates? </b>

I investigated whether increasing the **match ratio** (from 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1) has a statistically significant effect on the **likelihood that someone donates**.

To do this, I ran a series of **t-tests** comparing donation rates (`gave = 1`) across match ratio groups, restricting the sample to individuals who received a matching offer.


<b> T-Test Results by Match Ratio </b>

| Comparison         | t-statistic | p-value  | Interpretation                       |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| 1:1 vs 2:1 match   | -0.965      | 0.335    | ❌ Not statistically significant      |
| 1:1 vs 3:1 match   | -1.015      | 0.310    | ❌ Not statistically significant      |
| 2:1 vs 3:1 match   | -0.050      | 0.960    | ❌ Not statistically significant      |

<b> Interpretation </b>

These results show **no significant difference** in donation rates across the different match ratios. This means that:

- Increasing the match multiplier from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 does **not lead to a higher likelihood of giving**.
- This supports the statement from *Karlan & List (2007, p. 8)*:

> *"The gift distributions across the various matching ratios are not significantly different from one another."*

In other words, people **respond positively to the existence of a match**, but **not necessarily more** when the match becomes more generous.

<b> Conclusion </b>

The **presence of a match** appears to matter more than its **magnitude**. This suggests that:

> **Framing** and **social cues** — like simply saying "your gift will be matched" — may be more behaviorally powerful than the precise financial terms.

This insight is important for nonprofit fundraisers: focus on **highlighting the match** rather than inflating the ratio.


```{python}
# Ensure 'gave' is binary
df['gave'] = df['gave'].astype(int)

# Create dummy variables for each match ratio
# This is only for treatment group, so filter and prepare accordingly
df_ratio = df[df['treatment'] == 1].copy()
df_ratio['ratio'] = df_ratio['ratio'].astype(str)

# Create dummy variables: ratio1, ratio2, ratio3
df_ratio['ratio1'] = (df_ratio['ratio'] == '1').astype(int)
df_ratio['ratio2'] = (df_ratio['ratio'] == '2').astype(int)
df_ratio['ratio3'] = (df_ratio['ratio'] == '3').astype(int)

# Regression: gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3 (no intercept)
import statsmodels.api as sm

X = df_ratio[['ratio1', 'ratio2', 'ratio3']]
y = df_ratio['gave']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# model.summary()


# Format regression output
ratio_reg_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Match Ratio": ["1:1", "2:1", "3:1"],
    "Coefficient": model.params.values,
    "Std. Error": model.bse.values,
    "p-value": model.pvalues.values,
    "95% CI Lower": model.conf_int()[0].values,
    "95% CI Upper": model.conf_int()[1].values
}).round(4)

print('Reression Results:')
ratio_reg_table

```
<b> Behavioral Insight: Why Match Size Doesn't Matter (Much) </b>

This regression shows that all forms of match ratios — 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 — significantly increase the likelihood that someone donates, with donation rates clustering around **2%**.

However, the **differences between match sizes are extremely small**:

- People who saw a **1:1 match** donated at a rate of 2.07%.
- Those who saw a **2:1 match** gave at 2.26%.
- With a **3:1 match**, the rate was 2.27%.

These results suggest that **once a match is present, increasing its generosity has little additional impact**. In other words:

> **It's the existence of the match that matters, not its size.**

This behavior aligns with theories in behavioral economics:
- The match acts as a **signal of social proof** or endorsement.
- It may create a **sense of urgency or leverage** ("my donation matters more").
- But **donors aren't particularly sensitive** to how generous the match is — at least not in terms of deciding whether or not to give.

<b> Implication for Fundraising </b>

From a practical standpoint, this means that:
- Fundraisers **don’t need to offer high match ratios** to see results.
- A simple, clearly communicated 1:1 match may be **just as effective** as a 3:1 match in increasing participation.

This finding reinforces the power of **framing** and **perception** in influencing human behavior.


```{python}
# Compute the actual mean response (gave) for each ratio group directly from the data
mean_1_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "1"]["gave"].mean()
mean_2_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "2"]["gave"].mean()
mean_3_1 = df_ratio[df_ratio["ratio"] == "3"]["gave"].mean()

# Calculate differences in response rates
diff_2_1_vs_1_1 = mean_2_1 - mean_1_1
diff_3_1_vs_2_1 = mean_3_1 - mean_2_1

# Extract coefficients from regression model
coef_1_1 = model.params["ratio1"]
coef_2_1 = model.params["ratio2"]
coef_3_1 = model.params["ratio3"]

# Calculate differences in coefficients
coef_diff_2_1_vs_1_1 = coef_2_1 - coef_1_1
coef_diff_3_1_vs_2_1 = coef_3_1 - coef_2_1

# (mean_1_1, mean_2_1, mean_3_1,
#  diff_2_1_vs_1_1, diff_3_1_vs_2_1,
#  coef_diff_2_1_vs_1_1, coef_diff_3_1_vs_2_1)


# Organize values into a formatted summary table
comparison_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Comparison": ["2:1 vs 1:1", "3:1 vs 2:1"],
    "Diff (means)": [diff_2_1_vs_1_1, diff_3_1_vs_2_1],
    "Diff (regression coefficients)": [coef_diff_2_1_vs_1_1, coef_diff_3_1_vs_2_1]
}).round(5)
print('Results:')
comparison_table
```
<b> Comparing Response Rates Across Match Ratios </b>

I examined how the size of the match (1:1 vs. 2:1 vs. 3:1) influences the probability that an individual makes a donation. I did this in two ways:

1. **Directly from the data** by calculating average donation rates within each match group.
2. **From the fitted coefficients** of a regression on dummy variables for each ratio.


<b> Response Rate Differences </b>

| Comparison              | Direct from Data | From Regression Coefficients |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2:1 vs 1:1 match         | 0.00188 (0.19%)   | 0.00188 (0.19%)              |
| 3:1 vs 2:1 match         | 0.00010 (0.01%)   | 0.00010 (0.01%)              |

- These differences represent **increases in the probability of donating** when moving from one match ratio to a higher one.
- The results are **identical across both methods**, which supports the robustness of the findings.


<b> Interpretation </b>

- Moving from a 1:1 to 2:1 match slightly increases donation rates by about **0.19 percentage points**.
- Increasing from a 2:1 to a 3:1 match has a **negligible effect** — only **0.01 percentage points**.
- These differences are **statistically very small** and are unlikely to be meaningful in practice.

<b> Conclusion </b>

Our analysis shows that:

> **Once a match is introduced, increasing the match ratio does not meaningfully increase the likelihood of giving.**

This confirms the finding from *Karlan & List (2007)*:

> *"The gift distributions across the various matching ratios are not significantly different from one another."*

In short, it's the **presence** of a match offer — not its **generosity** — that influences donor behavior.

### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

```{python}
# Run a t-test on the amount given between treatment and control groups
amount_treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']
amount_control = df[df['control'] == 1]['amount']
amount_ttest = ttest_ind(amount_treat, amount_control, equal_var=False)

# Run a bivariate linear regression: amount ~ treatment
amount_reg = smf.ols('amount ~ treatment', data=df).fit()

# amount_ttest.statistic, amount_ttest.pvalue, amount_reg.summary()

# Format regression output into a clean table
amount_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Variable": amount_reg.params.index,
    "Coefficient": amount_reg.params.values,
    "Std. Error": amount_reg.bse.values,
    "p-value": amount_reg.pvalues.values,
    "95% CI Lower": amount_reg.conf_int()[0].values,
    "95% CI Upper": amount_reg.conf_int()[1].values
}).round(4)

amount_table

```
<b> Size of Charitable Contribution </b>

I tested whether receiving a matching donation offer affects the **amount** donated using a t-test and linear regression:


<b> Results </b>

| Method            | Treatment Effect | p-value | Conclusion                          |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| T-Test            | +$0.15           | 0.055   | 🔸 Marginally not significant        |
| Regression        | +$0.15           | 0.063   | 🔸 Suggestive but inconclusive       |

- **Control group average**: ~$0.81  
- **Treatment group average**: ~$0.96

<b> Interpretation </b>

- The **treatment group gave slightly more**, but the difference is **not statistically significant** at the 5% level.
- This suggests that while **match offers increase participation**, they have a **much smaller effect** on how much people give.

<b> Takeaway </b>

> Matching donations may encourage more people to give, but **do not substantially increase donation size**.



```{python}
# Limit the data to only those who made a donation (amount > 0)
df_positive = df[df['amount'] > 0].copy()

# T-test for amount among donors only
amount_treat_pos = df_positive[df_positive['treatment'] == 1]['amount']
amount_control_pos = df_positive[df_positive['control'] == 1]['amount']
amount_ttest_pos = ttest_ind(amount_treat_pos, amount_control_pos, equal_var=False)

# Regression: amount ~ treatment (for donors only)
amount_reg_pos = smf.ols('amount ~ treatment', data=df_positive).fit()

# amount_ttest_pos.statistic, amount_ttest_pos.pvalue, amount_reg_pos.summary()


# Clean regression summary
amount_conditional_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Variable": amount_reg_pos.params.index,
    "Coefficient": amount_reg_pos.params.values,
    "Std. Error": amount_reg_pos.bse.values,
    "p-value": amount_reg_pos.pvalues.values,
    "95% CI Lower": amount_reg_pos.conf_int()[0].values,
    "95% CI Upper": amount_reg_pos.conf_int()[1].values
}).round(4)

amount_conditional_table

```
<b> Conditional Donation Amount: Among Donors Only </b>

To isolate the effect of treatment on the **amount given**, I restricted the sample to only those individuals who **made a donation** (`amount > 0`).

I used both a t-test and a bivariate regression (`amount ~ treatment`) to compare average donation sizes between treatment and control groups.

<b> Results Summary </b>

| Method                | Treatment Effect | p-value | Conclusion                        |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| T-Test (donors only)  | t = -0.58        | 0.559   | ❌ Not statistically significant   |
| Regression            | -$1.67           | 0.561   | ❌ Not statistically significant   |

- **Control group average donation**: ~$45.54  
- **Treatment group average donation**: ~$43.87

<b> Interpretation </b>

- The treatment group **donated slightly less** on average, but the difference is **not statistically meaningful**.
- This suggests that while the **match offer encourages more people to donate**, it does **not increase donation size** among those who would give anyway.
- Because I only included those who donated, the **treatment effect here is not causal** — it’s **conditional** and may suffer from **selection bias**.

<b> Conclusion </b>

> Matched donations are effective at increasing the **number** of donors, but **not the amount donated** by each donor — at least among those who already choose to give.



```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Filter to donors only
df_donors = df[df["amount"] > 0]

# Separate treatment and control donors
treat_donors = df_donors[df_donors["treatment"] == 1]["amount"]
control_donors = df_donors[df_donors["control"] == 1]["amount"]

# Calculate means
mean_treat = treat_donors.mean()
mean_control = control_donors.mean()

# Create side-by-side histograms
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4), sharey=True)

# Control group plot
axes[0].hist(control_donors, bins=30, color="skyblue", edgecolor="black")
axes[0].axvline(mean_control, color="red", linestyle="--", label=f"Mean = ${mean_control:.2f}")
axes[0].set_title("Control Group Donations")
axes[0].set_xlabel("Donation Amount")
axes[0].set_ylabel("Frequency")
axes[0].legend()

# Treatment group plot
axes[1].hist(treat_donors, bins=30, color="lightgreen", edgecolor="black")
axes[1].axvline(mean_treat, color="red", linestyle="--", label=f"Mean = ${mean_treat:.2f}")
axes[1].set_title("Treatment Group Donations")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Donation Amount")
axes[1].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
<b> Distribution of Donation Amounts Among Donors </b> 

I am now focusing on individuals who **actually made a donation** (`amount > 0`) to analyze how much they gave, and whether the **treatment group** (those offered a matching donation) gave more than the control group.

I visualized the **distribution of donation amounts** with two histograms — one for each group — and include a **red dashed line** indicating the **average donation** in each.

<b> Interpretation </b> 

- Both distributions are **heavily right-skewed**, which is common in charitable giving: most donors give modest amounts, but a few give significantly more.
- The **average donation** in the **control group** was about **$45.54**, while the **treatment group** averaged **$43.87**.
- This difference is **not statistically significant**, as confirmed by both a t-test and a regression limited to donors.

<b> What Did I Learn? </b> 

- While the **matching donation offer increases the probability of donating**, it does **not increase the donation amount** among those who choose to give.
- In fact, the average donation in the treatment group is slightly lower, though the difference is not meaningful.

<b>  Important Caveat </b> 

This analysis is based only on people who gave, so the **treatment coefficient does not have a causal interpretation** here. This subset is **not randomly assigned** — it's a selected group, which may differ systematically between treatment and control.

<b> Fundraising Implication </b>

> Matching offers are powerful tools to **increase participation**, but they do not necessarily lead to **larger individual gifts**.

To increase average donation size, fundraisers may need additional tactics — such as **suggested donation levels**, **tiered match thresholds**, or **social proof**.


## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers


```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract donation amounts for control and treatment
control_data = df[df["control"] == 1]["amount"]
treatment_data = df[df["treatment"] == 1]["amount"]

# Simulate draws from each distribution
np.random.seed(42)
sim_control = np.random.choice(control_data, size=100_000, replace=True)
sim_treatment = np.random.choice(treatment_data, size=10_000, replace=True)

# Calculate 10,000 differences between treatment and control draws
sim_control_subset = np.random.choice(sim_control, size=10_000, replace=False)
diffs = sim_treatment - sim_control_subset

# Compute cumulative average of differences
cumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, len(diffs) + 1)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(cumulative_avg, label="Cumulative Average Difference")
plt.axhline(y=np.mean(treatment_data) - np.mean(control_data), color="red", linestyle="--", label="True Mean Difference")
plt.title("Cumulative Average of Treatment-Control Differences")
plt.xlabel("Number of Draws")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Average Difference in Donation Amount")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
<b> Simulated Cumulative Average Differences </b>

To better understand the behavior of sample averages and connect to the concepts from our first class (Slide 43), we simulate the cumulative effect of donation differences between the treatment and control groups.

<b> Simulation Setup </b>

- I simulated **100,000 random draws** from the **control group** donation distribution.
- I simulated **10,000 random draws** from the **treatment group**.
- For each of the 10,000 pairs, I calculated the difference: `treatment - control`.
- I then computed the **cumulative average** of these 10,000 differences.


<b> Plot Interpretation </b>

The plot below shows:

- A **blue line** representing the **cumulative average** of the simulated differences.
- A **red dashed line** indicating the **true difference in means** between treatment and control groups (calculated from the full dataset).

As the number of draws increases, the **cumulative average approaches the true difference**.

This illustrates the **Law of Large Numbers**: with enough data, sample-based estimates converge to the population value.

<b> What I Learnt </b>

> This simulation confirms that even in noisy, skewed data like donations, repeated sampling yields reliable estimates.

It also demonstrates that the **difference in means** I computed from data is not just a fluke — it’s what we’d expect if I sampled repeatedly from the same distributions.

### Central Limit Theorem


```{python}
# Define a function to simulate mean differences for a given sample size
def simulate_differences(sample_size, n_reps=1000):
    differences = []
    for _ in range(n_reps):
        sample_control = np.random.choice(control_data, size=sample_size, replace=True)
        sample_treatment = np.random.choice(treatment_data, size=sample_size, replace=True)
        differences.append(np.mean(sample_treatment) - np.mean(sample_control))
    return differences

# Simulate for each sample size
np.random.seed(42)
sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]
simulated_results = {size: simulate_differences(size) for size in sizes}

# Plot histograms
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))
axes = axes.flatten()

for i, size in enumerate(sizes):
    axes[i].hist(simulated_results[size], bins=30, color='lightgray', edgecolor='black')
    axes[i].axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Zero")
    axes[i].set_title(f"Sample Size = {size}")
    axes[i].set_xlabel("Mean Difference (Treatment - Control)")
    axes[i].set_ylabel("Frequency")
    axes[i].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
<b> Sampling Distributions at Different Sample Sizes </b>

To mirror the exercise from Slide 44 of our first class, I simulated the **sampling distribution of the mean difference** in donation amount between the treatment and control groups.

For each of four different sample sizes — **50, 200, 500, and 1000** — I:

1. Drew `n` observations from each group.
2. Computed the difference in mean donation: `treatment - control`.
3. Repeated the process **1,000 times**.
4. Plotted the **histogram of those 1,000 average differences**.

<b> Histograms of Simulated Mean Differences </b>

Each plot includes a **red dashed line at zero**, representing the null hypothesis of no effect.

<b> Interpretation by Sample Size </b>

- **n = 50**: The distribution is wide and noisy. **Zero is near the center**, meaning we can't confidently detect an effect.
- **n = 200**: The distribution begins to narrow. Zero is still well within the range of plausible outcomes.
- **n = 500**: The histogram becomes more concentrated. The true effect begins to emerge, and **zero starts shifting toward the tails**.
- **n = 1000**: The distribution is tightly centered. **Zero lies in the tail**, indicating that the true average difference is likely **not zero**.

<b> Conclusion </b>

> As sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes **narrower and more centered around the true population effect**.

This exercise demonstrates:
- The **Law of Large Numbers**: larger samples produce more stable estimates.
- The power of simulation for understanding uncertainty and inference.
- Why small samples often yield inconclusive or misleading results.

These plots reinforce that while we may see noisy or overlapping outcomes in small samples, with enough data, we get **closer to the truth**.
